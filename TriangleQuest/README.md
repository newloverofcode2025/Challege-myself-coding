# Triangle Quest ðŸ”º

A Python script that generates a numerical triangle pattern based on user input.

## Features
- Accepts the number of rows as input from the user.
- Validates input to ensure only positive integers are accepted.
- Prints a numerical triangle where each row contains the row number repeated.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TriangleQuest.git
   cd TriangleQuest
   Explanation
The program works as follows:

Uses a loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 1 to the input number.
For each iteration, it prints the current number repeated as many times as the row number.
For example:

Row 1: 1
Row 2: 22
Row 3: 333
Row 4: 4444
Row 5: 55555
