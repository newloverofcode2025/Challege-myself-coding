# FizzBuzz Challenge ðŸŽ‰

A Python script that implements the classic FizzBuzz problem.

## Features
- Accepts an upper limit `n` as input from the user.
- Prints the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to `n`:
  - Multiples of 3 are replaced with "Fizz".
  - Multiples of 5 are replaced with "Buzz".
  - Multiples of both 3 and 5 are replaced with "FizzBuzz".
  - All other numbers are printed as-is.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FizzBuzz.git
   cd FizzBuzz
   Explanation
The program works as follows:

Prompts the user to input an upper limit n.
Iterates through numbers from 1 to n.
Applies the FizzBuzz rules:
If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If divisible by 3, print "Fizz".
If divisible by 5, print "Buzz".
Otherwise, print the number itself.
