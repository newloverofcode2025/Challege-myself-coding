# Sum of Cubes Calculator ðŸ”¢

A Python script that calculates the sum of cubes of all integers from `1` to `n`.

## Features
- Accepts a positive integer `n` as input from the user.
- Validates input to ensure only positive integers are accepted.
- Calculates the sum of cubes using two methods:
  1. Using a loop.
  2. Using the mathematical formula: `(n * (n + 1) / 2)Â²`.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SumOfCubesCalculator.git
   cd SumOfCubesCalculator

Using Loop: The sum of cubes from 1 to 5 is: 225
Using Formula: The sum of cubes from 1 to 5 is: 225
   Explanation
The program calculates the sum of cubes using two methods:

Loop Method : Iterates through all numbers from 1 to n, calculates their cubes, and sums them up.
Formula Method : Uses the mathematical formula (n * (n + 1) / 2)Â² to compute the result directly.
For example, calculating the sum of cubes for n = 5:
1Â³ + 2Â³ + 3Â³ + 4Â³ + 5Â³ = 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 + 125 = 225
