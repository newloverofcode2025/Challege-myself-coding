# Compound Interest Calculator ðŸ’°

A Python script that calculates the total amount and compound interest based on user inputs.

## Formula
The total amount is calculated using the compound interest formula:
A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
Where:
- `A` is the total amount (principal + interest).
- `P` is the principal amount (money borrowed or invested).
- `r` is the annual interest rate (in decimal form, e.g., 5% = 0.05).
- `n` is the number of times the interest is compounded per year.
- `t` is the time the money is borrowed or invested for (in years).

## Features
- Accepts principal amount, annual interest rate, time period, and compounding frequency as input from the user.
- Validates input to ensure only non-negative numbers are accepted.
- Calculates and displays the total amount and compound interest.
