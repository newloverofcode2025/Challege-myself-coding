# Armstrong Number Checker ðŸ”¢

A Python script that checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number.

## What is an Armstrong Number?
An Armstrong number (or Narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:
- `153` is an Armstrong number because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- `9474` is an Armstrong number because \( 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474 \).

## Features
- Accepts a non-negative integer as input from the user.
- Validates input to ensure only non-negative integers are accepted.
- Determines whether the number is an Armstrong number.
